# Keyestudio KS0212 RPI 4-channel Relay Shield Python Sample

The form factor of the Keyestudio KS0212 is great for simple Raspberry Pi projects. However, as a Raspberry Pi Python coder I had a hard time mapping the pin numbers used in the factory sample app for the KS0212 to GPIO numbers I could use with the Gpiozero python libary. To address that minor problem, I created this very simple Python 3 example demonstrating how to use the Keyestudio KS0212 with a Raspberry Pi 3 at: https://github.com/JohnFunkCode/keyestudio-ks02120-python-sample.

This simple example is in the file keyestudio-ks0212-sample.py.  It is simple enough you can simply copy and paste it into your Raspberry Pi or you can clone the entire repo and run it that way.
