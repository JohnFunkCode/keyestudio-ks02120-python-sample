# Keyestudio KS0212 RPI 4-channel Relay Shield Python Sample

I really like the form factor of the [Keyestudio KS0212](http://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-rpi-4-channel-relay-shield.html) for simple  Raspberry Pi projects.  However, as a Raspberry Pi Python coder I had a hard time mapping the pin numbers used in the factory sample app for the KS0212 to GPIO numbers I could use with the [Gpiozero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) libary.  To solve that problem, I created this very simple Python 3 example demonstrating how to use the Keyestudio KS0212 with a Raspberry Pi 3.

This simple example is in the file keyestudio-ks0212-sample.py.  It is simple enough you can simply copy and paste it into your Raspberry Pi or you can clone the entire repo and run it that way.
